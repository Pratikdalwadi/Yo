The boxes automatically generated on a PDF or image during Optical Character Recognition (OCR) are most commonly referred to as bounding boxes. These rectangular outlines are crucial for identifying and extracting specific pieces of information from a document.
The Role of Bounding Boxes in OCR
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a technology that converts different types of documents, such as scanned paper documents, PDFs, or images, into editable and searchable data.[1][2] The process fundamentally involves the OCR software analyzing an image to distinguish light areas (background) from dark areas (text).[3]
Here's how bounding boxes fit into this process:
Text Localization: Bounding boxes are used to precisely locate text elements within a document.[4] This is a critical step for accurate data extraction.
Object Detection: In a broader sense, bounding boxes are a fundamental concept in object detection, where they act as a reference point for identifying any object of interest within an image.[5] Data annotators draw these rectangles around objects to train machine learning models to recognize them.[5]
Hierarchical Structure: OCR systems can generate bounding boxes at different levels of granularity, including for individual characters, words, lines of text, or entire paragraphs. This hierarchical information helps in understanding the document's structure.
Advanced Document Understanding: Agentic Document Extraction and Landing AI
While traditional OCR focuses on converting images to text, more advanced systems like "Agentic Document Extraction" and platforms from companies like Landing AI offer a more sophisticated approach.
Agentic Document Extraction: This technology goes beyond simple text recognition. It interprets the content and understands the context of the document to identify and extract the most relevant information.[6] Unlike traditional OCR, which might just pull out all the text, an agentic system can identify specific fields like "Account Number" or "Invoice Total" by understanding the document's layout and semantics.[6][7] These systems use AI to handle complex layouts, including tables, charts, and forms, without needing predefined templates.[7][8]
