Yes, you can handle parts of deep learning or neural network tasks using Replit, but it's not ideal for everything—especially heavy training of large models—due to platform limitations. I'll break it down step by step based on what Replit supports, focusing on your context of building something like layout-aware document analysis (e.g., for an agentic doc AI). Since you mentioned you're non-technical but work with Python and tools like Google Colab, I'll keep this practical and suggest simple ways to get started.

What Replit Supports for Deep Learning
Replit is a cloud-based coding platform that's great for quick prototyping, collaboration, and running code in the browser. It has built-in AI features and templates that make it easier for ML tasks:

Running Pre-Trained Models: This is straightforward and doesn't require much compute. You can use libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Hugging Face Transformers to load and run existing neural networks for tasks like document layout detection. For example:

Replit has AI templates (e.g., for embeddings or LLMs) where you can integrate models from Hugging Face or Replicate.

You could implement a basic layout analysis by loading a pre-trained model like LayoutParser or DocLayout-YOLO, process a document image, and get bounding boxes without training anything yourself.

Simple Training or Fine-Tuning: For small-scale neural networks, Replit works fine on CPU. You can train basic models (e.g., a small CNN for image classification) using Python in a Repl. They provide GPU access in beta mode, which helps for slightly heavier tasks:

Enable "Explorer" mode in your account settings to access GPUs (limited to 375 cycles per day per Repl, where cycles are like compute credits).

Use GPU-enabled templates, like their Python Data Science one, which includes TensorFlow and supports tasks like training on datasets under 1GB.

Integration with External Services: Replit makes it easy to connect to APIs for ML. For instance:

Use Replicate to run cloud-hosted models (e.g., for OCR or layout detection) without local training.

Combine with your past work in Google Colab by importing notebooks or code snippets.

Limitations and Challenges
While Replit is user-friendly, it's not built for intensive deep learning like training large neural networks from scratch (e.g., for custom layout-aware models). Here's why:

No Free GPU Access: Training complex models needs GPUs for speed, but Replit's GPU is beta-only, paid (via cycles or subscriptions), and limited. Without it, CPU training is slow for anything beyond tiny datasets—expect hours or days for even moderate tasks.

Storage and Resource Caps: Free Repls have 1GB storage, which is often too small for large datasets (e.g., document images for layout training). RAM and CPU are also virtualized and shared, so big jobs might timeout or fail.

Not Optimized for Heavy ML: Users report it's better for inference (running models) than training. For example, if you're trying to replicate Landing AI's deep learning for layout analysis, you'd hit walls with dataset size or compute time.

Alternatives if Replit Falls Short: Since you've used Google Colab before, that's a better free option for GPU-heavy tasks—it offers free T4 GPUs for training. You could prototype in Replit for quick tests, then move to Colab for the deep learning parts.

How to Get Started on Replit
If you want to try the deep learning side for document layout analysis, here's a simple plan:

Create a Repl: Go to replit.com, start a new Python Repl, and install libraries via the shell (e.g., pip install torch torchvision layoutparser).

Basic Example Code: Here's a minimal Python snippet to run a pre-trained layout detection model (using LayoutParser). Paste this into a Repl and run it—you'll need to upload a sample document image.

python
import layoutparser as lp
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Load a pre-trained model
model = lp.Detectron2LayoutModel(
    'lp://PubLayNet/faster_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x/config', 
    extra_config=["MODEL.ROI_HEADS.SCORE_THRESH_TEST", 0.8],
    label_map={0: "Text", 1: "Title", 2: "List", 3: "Table", 4: "Figure"}
)

# Load and process an image
image = Image.open("your_document_image.jpg").convert("RGB")
image_array = np.array(image)

# Detect layout
layout = model.detect(image_array)

# Print detected elements with bounding boxes
for block in layout:
    print(f"Type: {block.type}, Coordinates: {block.coordinates}")
Enable GPU if Needed: For faster runs, turn on Explorer mode and select GPU in the Repl settings. Test with small data first.

Scale Up: If this works, experiment with fine-tuning (e.g., add your own document data), but monitor resource usage. Replit's docs have tutorials on ML hosting.

Replit shines for the non-deep-learning parts of your project, like building the agentic workflow or UI, thanks to its AI agents and easy deployment. If your goal is just prototyping the neural network piece without full training, it's totally doable. If you run into specific errors or need help with code, share more details!
