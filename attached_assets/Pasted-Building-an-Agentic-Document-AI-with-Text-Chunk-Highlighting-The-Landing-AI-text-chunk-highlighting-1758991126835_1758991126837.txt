Building an Agentic Document AI with Text Chunk Highlighting
The Landing AI text chunk highlighting mechanism works through a sophisticated coordinate-based system that maps extracted text to precise locations in the original document. Here's how they achieve this functionality:

The Core Architecture
Landing AI's Agentic Document Extraction uses a grounding system that ties each extracted text chunk to its exact position in the source document. This enables the interactive highlighting feature you see when clicking on extracted text.

Key Components
Grounding Mechanism
Each extracted text chunk contains grounding information with:

Page index: Which page the text appears on (0-based indexing)

Bounding box coordinates: Precise rectangular coordinates using relative positioning

Chunk metadata: Type of content (title, table, figure, text, etc.)

Coordinate System
The bounding box uses relative coordinates with four values:

l (left): X-coordinate of left edge

t (top): Y-coordinate of top edge

r (right): X-coordinate of right edge

b (bottom): Y-coordinate of bottom edge

All coordinates are normalized between 0 and 1, making them resolution-independent.

JSON Schema Structure
The API returns structured data with this format:

json
{
  "markdown": "user-friendly text representation",
  "chunks": [
    {
      "text": "extracted text content",
      "chunk_id": "unique identifier",
      "chunk_type": "text|table|figure|title|etc",
      "grounding": [
        {
          "page": 0,
          "box": {
            "l": 0.1,
            "t": 0.2, 
            "r": 0.8,
            "b": 0.4
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Implementation Process
1. Document Processing
The system processes PDFs using computer vision and layout analysis to:

Identify text regions, tables, figures, and other elements

Extract text content while preserving spatial relationships

Generate bounding box coordinates for each element

Maintain page-level organization

2. Coordinate Transformation
When displaying highlights, the relative coordinates must be converted to pixel coordinates:

python
# Convert relative coordinates to pixel coordinates
def transform_coordinates(bbox, img_width, img_height):
    x1 = int(bbox['l'] * img_width)
    y1 = int(bbox['t'] * img_height)  
    x2 = int(bbox['r'] * img_width)
    y2 = int(bbox['b'] * img_height)
    return (x1, y1, x2, y2)
3. Interactive Highlighting
The frontend implementation involves:

Converting PDF pages to images for display

Overlaying clickable regions based on bounding box coordinates

Highlighting selected chunks by drawing rectangles over the corresponding areas

Synchronizing between text chunks and visual highlights

Technical Advantages
Resolution Independence
Using relative coordinates (0-1 range) ensures highlights work correctly regardless of PDF rendering DPI or zoom level.

Multi-Element Support
Each chunk can have multiple grounding entries, supporting text that spans multiple areas or pages.

Precise Mapping
The system maintains exact spatial relationships between extracted content and source locations, enabling accurate visual feedback.

Building Your Own Implementation
To replicate this functionality, you would need:

Backend Components
OCR/Layout Analysis Engine: Extract text and determine bounding boxes

Coordinate System: Implement relative positioning (0-1 normalized)

Chunk Processing: Group related text elements while maintaining spatial metadata

API Layer: Return structured data with text + grounding information

Frontend Components
PDF Renderer: Display PDF pages as images or canvas elements

Coordinate Transformation: Convert relative to pixel coordinates

Overlay System: Draw highlights and handle click interactions

Synchronization: Link text chunks to visual highlights

Key Libraries and Tools
PDF Processing: PDF.js, PyMuPDF, or similar for rendering

OCR: Tesseract, AWS Textract, or Google Vision API for text extraction

Computer Vision: OpenCV for image processing and coordinate manipulation

Frontend: Canvas API or SVG overlays for drawing highlights

The sophisticated part of Landing AI's implementation is the layout-aware analysis that accurately identifies document structure while maintaining precise spatial relationships. This goes beyond simple OCR by understanding visual document elements and their contextual relationship
